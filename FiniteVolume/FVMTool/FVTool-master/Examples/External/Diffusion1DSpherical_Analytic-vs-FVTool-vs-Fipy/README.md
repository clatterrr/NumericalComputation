# "1D Spherical" diffusion. Diffusion of an initial sphere into an infinite medium

by M.H.V. Werts, 2020

In this example, we study a simple diffusion problem of spherical symmetry, using spherical coordinates, *i.e.* "one-dimensional spherical" geometry. The initial condition represents all matter homogeneously confined in a sphere of radius *a*, which is subsequently allowed to diffuse freely inside an infinite medium. An analytic solution exists for this problem, and we compare this to numerical solutions obtained using the finite volume method through Fipy and FVTool.
